    <p> <b>Cardiac arrest</b> is when the heart stops beating.It is a medical emergency that, without immediate medical intervention, will result in cardiac death within minutes. When it happens suddenly, it is called sudden cardiac arrest. <b>Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)</b> and possibly defibrillation are needed until further treatment can be provided. Cardiac arrest results in a rapid loss of consciousness, and breathing may be abnormal or absent
While cardiac arrest may be caused by heart attack or heart failure, these are not the same, and in 15 to 25% of cases, there is a non-cardiac cause.Some individuals may experience chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, an elevated heart rate, and a light-headed feeling immediately before entering cardiac arrest.
 The most common cause of cardiac arrest is an underlying heart problem like coronary artery disease that decreases the amount of oxygenated blood supplying the heart muscle.This, in turn, damages the structure of the muscle, which can alter its function.These changes can, over time, cause ventricular fibrillation (V-fib), which most commonly precedes cardiac arrest.Less common causes include major blood loss, lack of oxygen, very low potassium, electrical injury, heart failure, inherited heart arrhythmias, and intense physical exercise. Cardiac arrest is diagnosed by the inability to find a pulse.</p>

    <h3>Why sudden cardiac arrest deaths happen?</h3><hr>
<center><p>
    According to <b>Dr Rakesh Kumar Jaswal</b>, Director and HOD of Cardiology at Fortis Hospital in Mohali, a sudden cardiac arrest occurs due to a cardiac disease. He said, “In the case of cardiac disease, 80% of people have coronary arteries which are blocked therefore, the patients may not even get a chance to complain about the pain. So, it is very important to diagnose coronary artery disease well in advance if a sudden cardiac arrest death has to be prevented.” He added,<b> “About 20% of sudden cardiac arrest deaths are due to diseases like cardiomyopathy with are hereditary.</b> So, if you have a family history of heart disease, then you should get yourself tested for it too.”
 <b>Ventricular fibrillation</b> is a type of arrhythmia and is the most common cause of cardiac arrest. Ventricular fibrillation is a rapid heartbeat in the heart's ventricle, which causes the heart to tremble instead of normally pumping blood.
Cardiac arrest is not preceded by any warning symptoms in approximately 50 percent of people.For individuals who do experience symptoms, the symptoms are usually nonspecific to the cardiac arrest.This can present in the form of new or worsening:
 chest pain,fatigue,blackouts,dizziness,shortness of breath,weakness,vomiting.When cardiac arrest is suspected by a layperson due to signs of unconsciousness and abnormal breathing, it should assumed that the victim is in cardiac arrest, and CPR should be initiated. If suspected by a trained healthcare professional, they should attempt to feel for a pulse for 10 seconds before initiating CPR. As a result of loss of cerebral perfusion (blood flow to the brain), the person will rapidly lose consciousness and can stop breathing. Near-death experiences are reported by 10 to 20 percent of people who survived cardiac arrest.</center>
</p><h3>How to prevent cardiac arrests?</h3><hr>Through precautions like, Maintaining a <b>healthy diet</b>, such as the Mediterranean diet, a vegetarian, vegan or another plant-based diet,<b>Decrease body fat</b> if overweight or obese. The effect of weight loss is often difficult to distinguish from dietary change, and evidence on weight reducing diets is limited. In observational studies of people with severe obesity, weight loss following bariatric surgery is associated with a 46% reduction in cardiovascular risk,<b>Limit alcohol consumption </b>to the recommended daily limits. People who moderately consume alcoholic drinks have a 25–30% lower risk of cardiovascular disease.However, people who are genetically predisposed to consume less alcohol have lower rates of cardiovascular disease suggesting that alcohol itself may not be protective. Excessive alcohol intake increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and consumption of alcohol is associated with increased risk of a cardiovascular event in the day following consumption
,Not enough sleep also raises the risk of high blood pressure. Adults need about<b> 7–9 hours of sleep</b>. Sleep apnea is also a major risk as it causes breathing to stop briefly, which can put stress on the body which can raise the risk of heart disease. </body>
